\hymn{adestoSanctaTrinitas}{
2 Thee all the armies of the sky
Adore, and laud, and magnify:
While Nature, in her triple frame,
For ever sanctifies thy Name.

3 And we, too, thanks and homage pay,
Thine own adoring flock to-day:
O join to that celestial song
The praises of our suppliant throng!

4 Light, sole and one, we thee confess,
With triple praise we rightly bless:
And Alpha and Omega own,
With every spirit round thy throne.

5 To thee, O Unbegotten One,
And thee, O Sole-begotten Son,
And thee, O Holy Ghost, we raise
Our equal and eternal praise.  Amen.
}

At Evensong.
\V Let us bless the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.  \R Let us praise him, and magnify him for ever.

At Mattins.
\V Blessed art thou, O Lord, in the firmament of heaven.  \R And worthy to be praised and glorified for ever.

At Lauds
\hymn{oPaterSancte}{
2 Trinity holy! Unity unchanging!
Godhead essential! Goodness all unbounded!
Light of the Angels! Refuge of the friendless!
Hope universal!

3 Duly its service giveth every creature;
All thy creation, Lord, in thee rejoiceth:
We too will hymn thee with our heart’s devotion;
Graciously hear us.

4 Mightiest Godhead, unto thee be glory,
Trinal yet Onely, Infinite and Highest:
Glory and honour, song and praise beseem thee
Now and for ever. Amen.

\V Blessed be the name of the Lord.  \R From this time forth for evermore.

\section{Corpus Christi}
and daily during the Octave

¶ At both Evensongs.
\hymn{sacrisSolemniis}{
2 Remember we that night,
When, the last Supper spread,
Christ, as we all believe,
The lamb, with leavenless bread,
Amongst his brethren shared,
And thus the Law obey’d,
Of old unto their sires declared.

3 The typick lamb consumed,
The Paschal feast complete,
The Lord unto the Twelve
His Body gave to eat;
The whole to all, no less
The whole to each, did mete
With his own hands, as we confess.

4 He gave them, weak and frail,
His Flesh, their food to be;
On them, downcast and sad,
His Blood bestowèd he:
And thus to them he spake,
‘Receive this Cup from me,
And all of you of this partake’.

5 When he this Sacrifice
To institute did will,
He to his Priests alone
That office to fulfil,
On this wise did confide—
To whom pertaineth still,
To take, and to the rest divide.

6 Lo! Angels’ Bread is made
The Bread of men to-day:
The living Bread from heav’n
With figures doth away:
O wondrous boon indeed!
Though poor and lowly, may
The servant on his Master feed.

7 Thee therefore we implore,
O Godhead, One in Three,
So may’st thou visit us
As we now worship thee;
And lead us on thy way,
That we at last may see
The Light wherein thou dwellest aye. Amen.
}
\V Thou didst give them bread from heaven.  \R Containing in itself all sweetness.

¶ At Mattins.
\hymn{pangeLinguaGloriosi}{
2 Given for us, for us descending
Of a Virgin to proceed,
Man with man in converse blending,
Scatter’d he the Gospel seed;
Till his sojourn drew to ending.
Which he closed in wondrous deed.

3 At the last great Supper seated,
Circled by his brethren’s band,
All the Law required, completed
In the feast its statutes planned,
To the Twelve himself he meted,
For their food, with his own hand.

4 Word made Flesh, by Word he maketh
Very bread his Flesh to be;
Man in wine Christ’s Blood partaketh,
And if senses fail to see,
Faith alone the true heart waketh
To behold the mystery.

5 Therefore we, before It bending,
This great Sacrament adore:
Types and shadows have their ending
In the new Rite evermore:
Faith, our outward sense amending,
Maketh good defects before.

6 Honour, laud, and praise addressing
To the Father and the Son,
Might ascribe we, virtue, blessing,
And eternal benison;
Holy Ghost, from Both progressing,
Equal laud to thee be done. Amen.
}
\V Thou didst give them bread from heaven.  \R Containing in itself all sweetness.

¶ At Lauds.
\hymn{verbumSupernumProdiens}{
2 By false disciple to be given
To foemen for his Blood athirst,
Himself, the living Bread from heav’n,
He gave to his disciples first.

3 To them he gave, in two-fold kind,
His very Flesh, his very Blood:
Of two-fold substance man is made.
And he of man would be the Food.

4 At birth our Brother he became,
Our Food, while seated at the board:
He died our Ransomer to be,
He reigns to be our great Reward.

5 O Saving Victim, opening wide
The gate of heav’n to man below:
Our foes press on from every side,
Thine aid supply, thy strength bestow.

6 To thy great Name be endless praise,
Immortal Godhead, One in Three!
O grant us endless length of days
In our true native land, with thee. Amen.
}
\V He maketh peace in thy borders.  \R And filleth thee with the flour of wheat.


\gregorioscore{\MyPath/processions/salveFestaCorpusChristi}


3 Here is the Body of Christ, that saveth from death everlasting,—
Food by the manna foretold, writ in the records of yore.

4 Here is the Father’s Word, of heaven and earth the Creator;
He, with the Father one, blest with his Godhead the world.

5 Here is the Angels’ Bread, to the righteous the food of salvation,—
Bread that availeth not them that receive it in sin.

6 He, the Incarnate God, who stablish’d the work of creation,
Trampling on hell’s dread hosts, ruleth, Redeemer and King.

7 He in the fulness of time was born by a wondrous conception,
Son of a spotless Maid, guest of a virginal womb.

8 His very Flesh and Blood he took, when at supper reclining,
And the disciples twelve fed with the mystical gifts.

9 Thus doth the Virgin-born, the Father’s infinite Wisdom,
Plead as a Victim true, laid on the altar of God.

10 Thron’d on the Cross in the flesh, o’er death he triumph’d in dying,
Saving the world from sin, cleans’d by the Water and Blood.

11 Purchasing life by death, his palms our Ransom extended;
And, when the third day dawn’d, rose in the flesh from the grave.

12 Grant us eternal rest, primeval Fountain of blessings;
Ours be the land where day dureth, and night is unknown.

Hymn 13 (E)

\chapter{Common of Saints}
\section{Of a Virgin}

Evensong and Mattins
(Proper evensong tune is as a confessor, iste confessor)
¶ Note that if the Virgin be not a Martyr, verses 2 and 3 are ommitted.
¶ For Many Virgins, the hymn and \V is {Ihesu, corona virginum}, as at Lauds.
¶ For a Matron, begin at verse 4.

\hymn{virginisProles}{
*2 She, thine own maiden, double blessing winneth,
Striving to vanquish all her nature’s weakness.
E’en by that weakness o’er a world of bloodshed
Victory gaining.

*3 Death and its terrors undismay’d beholding,
Death’s cruel handmaid, torture, she despiseth;
Shedding her life-blood, meet is she to enter
Holiest heaven.

4 God ever-loving, as for us she pleadeth,
Pity our failings, all our sins forgiving:
Thus shall re-echo pure and heart-felt praises
Unto thine honour.

5 Praise to the Father, to the Sole-begotten,
And the blest Spirit, with the twain co-equal,
One only Godhead, who throughout the ages
Reigneth for ever. Amen.
}

{Evensong.} \V Full of grace are thy líps. \R Therefore God hath blessed thee for éver. (Allelúya).

{Mattins.} \V God shall give her the help of his cóuntenance.  \R God is in the midst of her, therefore shall she not be remóved. (Allelúya).


L2E Jesu corona Virginum
¶ For Many Virgins, the hymn and \V is {Rex gloriose martyrum}, as at Lauds for Many Martyrs.
¶ This tune is for 2nd Evensong; At Mattins it is sung to {Veni, redemptor Gentium}.  During Christmas tide, at both hours, to Christe Redemptor Omnium, and during eastertide to Aurora Lucit - apostles

\hymn{jesuCoronaVirginum}{
2 Among the lilies thou dost feed,
By Virgin quires accompanied—
With glory deck’d, the spotless brides
Whose bridal gifts thy love provides.

3 They, wheresoe’er thy footsteps bend,
With hymns and praises still attend:
In blessed troops they follow thee,
With dance, and song, and melody.

4. We pray thee therefore to bestow
Upon our senses here below
Thy grace, that so we may endure
From taint of all corruption pure.

Ordinary Doxology:
5 All laud to God the Father be,
All praise, eternal Son, to thee:
All glory, as is ever meet,
To God the holy Paraclete. Amen.
}

\V The virgins that be her fellows shall bear her company.  \R And shall be brought unto thee.  (Alleluya).

Sequence
Virgines egregie

Virgin Saints of high renown,
Virgins consecrated,
Ye before your Spouse appear
Crown’d and decorated:
With the everlasting rest
Ye on high are gifted;
Let a new-made song of praise
To your Lord be lifted.

Chastity’s own lily sweet
Ye were well deserving,
For the love of God’s dear Son,
Which ye were preserving:
Ye, to be the Spirit’s shrine,
As your lot were choosing,
Earthly love and wedlock’s bonds
Constantly refusing.

Flowers of holy modest
Were your chiefest treasure;
So ye trod beneath your feet
Every fleshly pleasure:
Thus the prize of purity
Hath to you been meted;
With the Virgin’s stainless Son
Ye for aye are seated.
